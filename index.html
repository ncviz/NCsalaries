            <p>A tool to explore the current, reported base salaries of UNC system as found on the publicly available <a href="https://uncdm.northcarolina.edu/salaries/index.php">UNC Salary Information Database.</a> The following Institutions/Campuses are included: ASU, ECU, ECSU, FSU, NCA&T, NCCU, NCSU, UNCA, UNC-CH, UNCC, UNC System Office, UNCG, UNCP, UNCW, UNCSA, WCU, WSSU, and NCSSM.</p>
            <p>Job titles and home departments are taken directly as reported by the UNC Salary Information Database. Job titles may not fit directly into a job category (e.g. "Assistant Professor in Geography" rather than "Assistant Professor) or may have spelling errors that prevent individuals from being included in job category groups (e.g. "Asstistant Professor" rather than "Assistant Professor"). These differences--whether in error or purposeful--have not been corrected from the source data.</p>
            <p>For data organization purposes, home departments/divisions have been sorted into Schools/Colleges when applicable. These data were taken from UNC system websites and may not be accurate or comprehensive. <a href= "https://forms.gle/e3TR9QRLTzCk5kEu7"> </a>Help add or correct these issues using this form.</p>
